## My goal
I aim to get a junior frontend developer job in 2023.

## My strengths:
- I'm passionate about studying and learning new things and I love complex tasks;
- vast experience in working remotely - I worked as a freelance translator from 2012 to 2019 and now I teach online working from home;
- experience in "tech stuff" - my major is linguistics & translation and I specialized in technical translation, including dealing with manuals and interpreting at construction works, assembly works and trial runs, and I'm not afraid of technical stuff;
- great googling skills - I had to google a lot in my previous job as a translator and most of the time it wasn't easy to find a certain term straight away, but I figured out a way to achieve that.

## Experience:
I don't have any real-life experience in frontend development, but I started a couple of pet projects including a website for my friend, who is the owner of an optical shop, and an application for checking users' knowledge of irregular verbs, which are quite important in English. I enjoy building web pages, especially introducing some JavaScript in them.

## Skills
- HTML5;
- CSS3;
- JavaScript (basics);
- Basic Git knowledge (I use Github Desktop and upload all my study projects and notes in my repository).

## Examples of code
- A study project at another school - a [hotel booking website](https://github.com/etrifonova/sedona-htmlacademy) (the project is not finished and requires more CSS and JS).
- My [Irregular Verbs Application](https://github.com/etrifonova/Pet-Project---Irregular-Verbs-App) (minimum of HTML и CSS; the first button (generate) works, but the second one (check) doesn't - I've been trying to fix it for quite some time now; I've tried around 4 different ways of setting the button, but all of them had a sort of bug; I need to study more to find a solution).
- My solution for the codewars Descending Order kata:

```
function descendingOrder(n){
  let strNum = String(n);
      strNumArr = strNum.split("");
      strNumArrSorted = strNumArr.sort((a,b) => a - b);
      strNumArrSorted = strNumArrSorted.reverse();
      strNum = strNumArrSorted.join("");
      return parseInt(strNum);
}
```

- In the summer of 2011, I worked in a restaurant in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA.
- I practise English on a regular basis - I teach students at B1 and higher and I watch and read in English every day.
- I always google things I need for my programming needs in English.
